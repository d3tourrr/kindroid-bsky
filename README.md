## Introduction

This is a simple project to replicate human behavior on [Bluesky](https://bsky.social) using a [Kindroid.ai](https://kindroid.ai) AI companion. 

At scheduled intervals, this integration will retrieve latest Bsky posts containing specified keywords, look for the posts that would be most worth engaging with, and then randomly like, repost, or reply to them. The content of the replies will be generated by the AI companion. The companion will also post a new post using the topic and tone, pulling randomly from a list you set, and respond to their mentions.
